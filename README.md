nextjs + prisma & postgres + better auth (Authentication template) <br/>

Authentication is done with the help of better auth library.<br/>
keypoints:<br/>
email is unique in the schema generated by the better auth library so checking the user exists is done by email.<br/>


check whether the better auth also provides the scheduled cleanup for the sessions stored in the db<br/>


things to change:<br/>
change the google oAuth client id's authorized redirect url when deployed.<br/>
change the github homepage url and authorization callback url to that deployed url as well.<br/>
also change them in the projects as well.<br/>

observations:<br/>
single user can have multiple accounts (by credential/github/google) <br/>


migrations are not pushed, one must do npm i then initiallize prisma and migrate to db and generate the google/github oAuth <br/>
